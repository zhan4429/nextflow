n Nextflow, a process is the basic processing primitive to execute a user script.

The process definition starts with the keyword `process`, followed by process name and finally the process body delimited by curly brackets. The process body must contain a string which represents the command or, more generally, a script that is executed by it. A basic process looks like the following example:

```
process doMoreThings {
  shell '/bin/bash', '-euo', 'pipefail'

  """
  blastp -db $db -query query.fa -outfmt 6 > blast_result
  cat blast_result | head -n 10 | cut -f 2 > top_hits
  blastdbcmd -db $db -entry_batch top_hits > sequences
  """
}
```

Since Nextflow uses the same Bash syntax for variable substitutions in strings, you must manage them carefully depending on whether you want to evaluate a Nextflow variable or a Bash variable.

When you need to access a system environment variable in your script, you have two options.

If you donâ€™t need to access any Nextflow variables, you can define your script block with single-quotes:
```
process printPath {
  '''
  echo The path is: $PATH
  '''
}
```
Otherwise, you can define your script with double-quotes and escape the system environment variables by prefixing them with a back-slash `\` character, as shown in the following example:

```
process doOtherThings {
  """
  blastp -db \$DB -query query.fa -outfmt 6 > blast_result
  cat blast_result | head -n $MAX | cut -f 2 > top_hits
  blastdbcmd -db \$DB -entry_batch top_hits > sequences
  """
}
```
In this example, `$MAX` is a Nextflow variable that must be defined elsewhere in the pipeline script. Nextflow replaces it with the actual value before executing the script. Meanwhile, `$DB` is a Bash variable that must exist in the execution environment, and Bash will replace it with the actual value during execution.
